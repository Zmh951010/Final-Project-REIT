## Background and Motivation
This is an interpretative news about Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), since there exist more and more financial distress for Chinese Mainland long-term rental apartments, the attention to REITs has risen as well, people talking about REITs as a saver to these developers, and for investors, REITs are also a good choice since their long-term return is higher than other kinds of investments.
So whether REITs can be the key point of improving the liquidity of property developers, and whether they are really good and safe investment as people said is what we want to explore.
